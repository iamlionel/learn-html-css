      Bitcoin, introduced in a 2008 white paper by an anonymous person or group
      known as Satoshi Nakamoto, is a decentralized digital currency that
      operates without a central authority or intermediary. It utilizes a
      peer-to-peer network to facilitate transactions directly between users,
      verified by network nodes through cryptography. This revolutionary concept
      of a decentralized ledger called blockchain underpins Bitcoin, ensuring
      transparency and security. Bitcoin's scarcity is enforced by its
      algorithm, which limits the total supply to 21 million coins. Initially
      met with skepticism, Bitcoin has grown into a globally recognized asset
      and payment system, attracting attention for its potential to reshape
      finance, challenge traditional banking systems, and serve as a store of
      value and medium of exchange in the digital age. Its impact continues to
      evolve, influencing discussions on technology, economics, and the future
      of money worldwide.
